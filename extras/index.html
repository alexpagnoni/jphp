         </ol>
   </ol>
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>About <strong>jphp.http</strong> package :</strong>
   <dl>
      <dd><strong>jphp.http</strong> package you will find those classes :
      <ol>
         <li>Cookie : a class that represent a cookie
         <li>UploadFile : an extension to File object to represent an file that has been uploaded via HTTP POST
         <li>HttpContext : a simple Context manager using file, and storing object that must be share by all user 
         <li>HttpRequest : a encapsulate http request to make more user friendly and object oriented access to http request

      <br>
      <dd><strong>jphp.http.servlet</strong> provide an web application configuration using XML file, if you are familiar with java web.xml  config file. So this package should be very interesting as I'll use it to implement the MVC framework.
      All classes you will find here extends from classes found in jphp.http package to add communication between Context, Session, Request and Response. 
      <br>
      Example, a request object should be able to create/load a session from user cookie information.
      <br>
      Check the demo to see how it is used
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>jphp.io</strong>, provide and easy and elegant input/output API using Reader/Writer  and FilterReader and FilterWriter interface.
      Extends classes or interface to extends functionnality. Exemple, I've extends FilterWriter to create a ObjectWriter providing a simpleway to write many object stream into a targeted Writer object. And a ObjectReader extends the FilterReader to stream the object writed by the ObjectWriter.
